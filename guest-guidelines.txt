Show/Guest Guidelines.

1. The show is a phone call. We'll record the call, but each of us also has to record the audio at their end and email it to Daniel in case something goes wrong. Please do not forget this part as it would suck to lose an entire show.

2. Coding Trek is a funny and smart show about how people's personalities and technology interact while they're trying to make something people want. That might be an app, an API, a workshop, a novel. If you're making something creative that you hope people will like, and you're using technology to do it, you might be a guest!

3. Keep it positive and funny at all costs. No name-calling. No anger except at the universe in general. If you hate some person or thing they're doing, don't name them or their thing. If you want to discuss their thing because you have passion about how bad it is, describe it in general terms and assume positive intent. "I don't understand why ...."

4. No/little cursing. A tiny bit goes a long way. Probably best to avoid it entirely

5. If you're planned to be on, we'll send you a list of questions ahead of time so you'll be prepared. Send us back your answers ahead of time. Some things we might want to ask more about! Some things we might want to skip

6. Find what you're passionate about and tell us about it. Listeners enjoy hearing somebody passionate about something even if they don't like the thing itself
