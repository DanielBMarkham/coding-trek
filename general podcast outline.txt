#### Could be audio podcast.  Simple to do.  Easy to edit.  Low barrier to entry.  People can listen in car or on walks.  

#### Could be video podcast.  Harder to do.  Harder to edit.  Higher barrier to entry.  People have to look at screen.
####                          But way easier to deal with technical content like code.
####                          Much more motivating.  Deeper connection with audience.  
####                          Maybe easier to get sponsors.
####                          The trick will be in the editing.  


#### If we're trying to go code-heavy, there's just no replacing video -- but people don't consume vodcasts as much as audio podcasts
#### Something to consider: isn't there a real-time video app where people can stream in comments/questions while you go along?
#### You can ignore it or acknowledge comments and questions and respond to them, almost like a radio call-in show
#### I thinkt Scott Adams is using this to great effect. I wonder if you could do realtime video and be able to respond
#### to the stream whenever you want and then convert into standard podcast/vodcast? (The tool is "Periscope")
#### Editing gives me a headache. So many options and things that are possible. What is important to spend time on and what isn't?


intro music 5-7 seconds?
welcome to Coding Trek!
I am XXXX
I am here because XXXX
I am YYYYY
I am here because YYYYY
This show is .....
We hope to provide value because......
We can help even more because We have done a lot of work in ZZZZ

We're both one of you. We code, we hack, etc.

Let's start episode #sxx, "TITLE"
more music from intro
Errata
X: How is Y doing? Tells story of week
Y: How is X doing? Tells story of week
(New things tried, Things learned, experiences had, benefits received. easy banter back-and-forth)

Introduce Guest.
Segment 1.  Discussion of Guest's role in industry.  Anecdotes, questions, banter.  Etc.

Segment 2. Deep Tech.  Code on screen (or in a gist, or some other downloadable place.) Talk about it.  Run it. Test it. Refactor it.  Break it.  Have a blast.

Segment 3. People issues.  Where we agree.  Where we disagree.  Problems.  Solutions.  Politics.  Agile.  Whatever.

What is "coding-trek"? (maybe not)

End with saying slogan together. Perhaps "Make Stuff People Want!""
