#### Could be audio podcast.  Simple to do.  Easy to edit.  Low barrier to entry.  People can listen in car or on walks.  

#### Could be video podcast.  Harder to do.  Harder to edit.  Higher barrier to entry.  People have to look at screen.
####                          But way easier to deal with technical content like code.
####                          Much more motivating.  Deeper connection with audience.  
####                          Maybe easier to get sponsors.
####                          The trick will be in the editing.
